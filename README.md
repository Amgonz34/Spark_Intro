# Spark_Intro

A repository to hold practice notebooks for learning spark. The goal here is to brush up on my spark skills and improve upon them by refreshing my basic skills as well as improving on my intermediate knowledge of spark. 

The work here consists of a mix of both practice work supplier by Rutgers University's data science bootcamp (primarily data sources) with independent work guided by pyspark documentation found here https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/
