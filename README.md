# Spark_Intro

A repository to hold practice notebooks I used for learning spark. The goal here is to brush up on my spark skills and improve upon them by refreshing my basic skills as well as improving on my intermediate knowledge of spark. 

The work here consists of a mix of both practice work done with Rutgers University's data science bootcamp with independent work guided by pyspark documentation found here https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/
